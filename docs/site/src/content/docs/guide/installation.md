## Install the Compiler

Floe ships as a single Rust binary called `floe`.

### From Source

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/milkyskies/floe
cd floe
cargo install --path .

# Verify
floe --version
```

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) 1.85+ (for building from source)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+ (for your project's build toolchain)

## Create a Project

```bash
# Scaffold a new Floe project
floe init my-app
cd my-app

# Install npm dependencies
npm install

# Compile .fl files
floe build src/

# Or watch for changes
floe watch src/
```

## Editor Setup

### VS Code

Install the **Floe** extension from the VS Code marketplace, or build from source:

```bash
cd editors/vscode
npm install
npm run build
```

The extension provides:
- Syntax highlighting for `.fl` files
- LSP integration (diagnostics, hover)
- Code snippets

### Other Editors

Floe includes an LSP server. Start it with:

```bash
floe lsp
```

Any editor with LSP support can connect to it.
